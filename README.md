  ### Introduction

Solutions with tests, tips and tutorials for <a href="https://www.codewars.com">Codewars</a> katas.
Almost every kata has a long solution and a shorter one, IMHO a long descriptive solution it's preferred over a cryptic one-liner, unless it's understandable for your entire team.
